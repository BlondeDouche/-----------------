Hello, my names William! Made this since i wanted to let people know a little bit more about me. Although i know everyone whos on here probably dosnt really want to get to know me/ is too lazy to read all of this.

   ~[ Okay ONE LAST TIME! Hi my names Will/William/Billy...i go by whatever nickname you decide to name me, kinda like a little critter on the side of the road :/ And I am a Canadian Artist! (woah canada) ~]
   
      I am also quite the shy fellow once you first meet me, but dont be alarmed. I am friendly! Just need to poke me outta my shell first and then ill open up all my lil secrets and stuff..(Once i open up its already too late your stuck with me FOREVER.) 
         And thats about it about me, everything else you wanna know has to come from playing with me in PT~ :)
